\begin{itemize}
	\item During online video streaming:
	\newline Changing bandwidth requirements
	\item Therefore many content distributors use HAS \cite{seufert:2015:hassurvey}
	\newline Effort: Send best possible video quality to clients 
	\item Objective video quality measurements are not adequate enough
	\item Find a link between predicted quality and user ratings:
	\newline Compare the VMAF metric \cite{lin2013:mmf,lin2014:fvqa} with MOS obtained by a subjective quality experiment following ITU P.910 recommendations \cite{rec1998p}.
