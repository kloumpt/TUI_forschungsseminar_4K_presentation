Online video streaming accounts for a large amount of Internet traffic. To adapt better to changing bandwidth requirements more and more content distributors employ HTTP Adaptive Streaming (\textit{HAS}), however the present availability of specific quality measures is not adequate. This paper aims for linking predicted quality and subjective user ratings based on the \textit{VMAF} metric and an \textit{ACR}-style experiment. Therefore, we analyzed encodings of six different 10-second sequences at varying resolutions up to \textit{UHD-1} with three bitrates per resolution and compared the results with ratings from the perceptual test based on a "na\"{\i}ve" and an "expert" encoding preset. Subsequently, we found that we could accurately predict our final subjective quality results using the \textit{VMAF} metric. Our aggressive optimization with the "expert" encoding preset saved bits and preserved quality at higher bitrates, but lead to visual quality degradation for low bitrates.
